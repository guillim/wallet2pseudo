# Wallet2Pseudo
Chrome extension to replace crypto wallet addresses of friends when browsing some websites, because it can be annoying to remember that `0x9590b5fc46a499ad1f6k72d39b5334b1b4987fb3` is `john` 

You can think about this extension as an ethereum, bitcoin... address decoder, enabling you to recognize the public addresses of your friends.

This extension stores the pseudo locally: no data gets out of your laptop => 100% secure & privacy
